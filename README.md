# More Bezos

This extension will play "Bezos I" by Bo Burnham every time you make an Amazon purchase.

## Installation

Before installing, clone this repository by pasting the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/intcreator/more-bezos.git
```

You will need to load this as an unpacked extension, which is actually pretty easy. The following instructions are paraphrased from [this source](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked):

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3. Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.

## Details

When you click "Place Your Order" a new small window is created on top of the active window to play the song. Once YouTube loads, tab in the new window is moved right next to your Amazon window in case you want to close or mute it. The new tab will automatically close after a while.
