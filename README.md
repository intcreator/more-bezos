# More Bezos

This extension will play "Bezos I" by Bo Burnham every time you make an Amazon purchase.

## Details

When you click "Place Your Order" a new small window is created on top of the active window to play the song. Once YouTube loads, tab in the new window is moved right next to your Amazon window in case you want to close or mute it. The new tab will automatically close after a while.
